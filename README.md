Interpretation of the plots:

1.Highly Correlated Features:

city, UCity, highway, UHighway, comb, and feScore are highly correlated with ghgScore (positive correlation ~0.9). This indicates that fuel economy metrics are closely tied to the greenhouse gas score.
co2 has a strong negative correlation (-0.94) with ghgScore, implying that higher COâ‚‚ emissions result in lower greenhouse gas scores.

2.Low Correlation:

Features like id, year, pv2, and pv4 show minimal correlation with ghgScore. These may not contribute much to predicting the target variable.
